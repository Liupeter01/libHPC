## 0x01 macOS Apple Silicon Notice

libHPC **does not support macOS ARM (Apple Silicon)**.

The reason is simple:
> **Apple’s recent macOS / Xcode toolchain updates introduced ABI changes in `libc++`, causing oneTBB and other HPC components to fail at link-time.**

These issues do not occur on Linux or Windows, and they did not occur on older macOS versions. Since the goal of libHPC is stable, reproducible high-performance computing, macOS ARM is excluded to avoid degraded reliability or performance.

## 0x02 macOS ARM Technical Post-Mortem

libHPC previously supported macOS ARM. However, recent Xcode toolchains explicitly mark several `libc++` ABI symbols as **FORBIDDEN** (Xcode displays a “prohibited symbol” icon). 

Specifically, **`std::__1::__hash_memory`**, a critical dependency for **oneTBB**, has been removed/hidden at the SDK level. 

Since this is a breaking change in the Apple SDK/Toolchain itself, it cannot be resolved within libHPC. As a result, macOS ARM support has been formally dropped to maintain the integrity of the HPC pipeline.
